Vesktop is a custom Discord desktop app.

### Main features

- Vencord pre-installed.
- Much more lightweight and faster than the official Discord app.
- Linux screenshare with sound and Wayland compatibility.
- Much better privacy, since Discord has no access to your system.
- Fixes scroll issues and other issues/nuisances present on the official Discord app for Linux.

### Not yet supported

- Global keybinds.
- For other things, see the [roadmap](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/issues/324).

#### Community packages

There are unofficial packages created by the community. They are not officially supported by us; so, before reporting issues, please first confirm the issue also happens on official builds. When in doubt, consult with their packager first. The Flatpak and AppImage should work on any distro that [supports them](https://flatpak.org/setup/), so I recommend you just use those instead!

- Arch Linux: [Vesktop on the Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?K=vesktop)
- NixOS: https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Discord#Vesktop
- Windows (via Scoop): https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=Vesktop

## Building from source

Packaging will create builds in the dist/ folder

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop
cd Vesktop

# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Either run it without packaging
pnpm start

# Or package
pnpm package
# Or only build the pacman target
pnpm package --linux pacman
# Or package to a directory only
pnpm package:dir
```
